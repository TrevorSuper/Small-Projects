Consider the right triangle example for the Model-View-Controller pattern on slide 17 in
Design Modeling 1. Create a graphical view (another view beside the textual view) of the
right triangle. The graphical view displays the same changes as the textual view when
changes are made to the right triangle model through the textual view. There is no need of the
controller for the graphical view as the user will interact through the controller of the textual
view. The graphical view is solely for displaying the changes made through the textual view.
Submit the source code and several screenshots of the graphical view showing changes.
