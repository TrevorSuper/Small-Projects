This repo really is just a notepad. It's for projects and other things too small to warrant their own repo.<br>
<br>
'Web' contains notes on JavaScript and HTML from when I started teaching myself about web programming. I promptly<br> stopped this because JavaScript sucks ass.<br>
'C++_Small' contains programs I wrote when learning from a small C++ course.<br>
'Java' is a joke folder.<br>
'EECS281' is data structures and algorithms practice in C++.<br>
'TriangleFXProject' is a disastrous question from a software engineering and practice college course that took way<br>
longer than it should have so I'm putting it here in hopes that it helps someone in the future.
